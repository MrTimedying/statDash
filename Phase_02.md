# Phase 2 - Enhanced Statistical Dashboard

## âœ… COMPLETED: Phase 2A - UI Foundation

### Graphic Overhaul - COMPLETED
- âœ… **Ant Design Integration**: Modern, professional UI library implemented
- âœ… **Dark/Light Theme System**: Complete theme toggle with persistent storage
- âœ… **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-friendly design with collapsible sidebar
- âœ… **Enhanced Dashboard**: Professional tabs, cards, and statistics components
- âœ… **Theme Persistence**: User preferences saved to localStorage
- âœ… **ControlPanel Refactoring**: Ant Design forms with InputNumber components

## âœ… COMPLETED: Phase 2B - Multi-Pair Simulation Capability

### Samples Simulations - COMPLETED
At the moment the app only allows to have 1 sample pair simulated for x number of times. My idea was to have a variable set of sample pairs, depending on the user will (for example 1 to n sample pairs) that can be also compared against each other in terms of results.

#### âœ… Completed Features:
1. **Multi-Pair Simulation Engine**: Complete TypeScript implementation with advanced statistical analysis
2. **Enhanced Data Structures**: Comprehensive type definitions for multi-pair simulations
3. **Cross-Pair Analysis**: Effect size comparisons, power analysis, significance correlation
4. **Statistical Power Analysis**: Automated power calculations and sample size recommendations
5. **Effect Size Interpretation**: Automatic classification and practical significance assessment
6. **Dynamic Pair Management**: Add/remove/clone sample pairs with intuitive UI
7. **Comparison Tables**: Cross-pair numerical results comparison with sorting and filtering
8. **Multiple Significance Thresholds**: Support for 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, and custom Î± levels
9. **Significance Analysis Tables**: Results comparison across different Î± thresholds
10. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators for long-running simulations
11. **Advanced UI Components**: Professional forms, tables, and progress indicators

#### ðŸŽ¯ Key Capabilities Delivered:
- **Multi-Pair Support**: 1-10 sample pairs simultaneously
- **Dynamic Management**: Add, remove, clone, and configure pairs
- **Cross-Pair Analysis**: Compare results across all pairs
- **Multiple Thresholds**: Configure custom significance levels
- **Statistical Power**: Automated power analysis and recommendations
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback for long simulations
- **Professional UI**: Ant Design components throughout
